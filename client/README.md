This is a single page application, built using ReactJs, MaterialUI, and Socket.io to mimic an in-browser video chat application. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run server and client

In the project directory, open two separate terminals:

### For client side
### `cd client`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### For server side
### `nodemon server.js` (warning: must have nodemon installed or this will not function properly)

This monitors the project directory and automatically restarts the node application when it detects any changes. This means that you do not have to stop and restart the server-side files in order for any changes to take effect.
